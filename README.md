# woofBots
This is a simple IRC bot for twitch.tv that I have developed with ideas from Supercubs and YasDomdaddy's streams

This is programmed with python and was done as a fun side project.

There are multiple different commands that are allowed to be done, mostly are made for the specified streamers above and their needs. Implementation for a database is added for point/loyalty system using sqlite.
